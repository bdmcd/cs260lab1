                        <p>We love Stoyan! Been using her for a couple years now. Pics come out amazing and be is so much fun. Now if only he could somehow remove my double chin ;);) LOL!!!<br/><br/>He will be our family photographer from here on out!</p>

                        <h4>Crystal H.</h4>
                        <p>I LOVE Stoyan's photos! They are beautiful, with natural lighting and a natural feel to what he's capturing. And I love that her sessions are fun, no pressure sessions.<br/>I found Stoyan here on YELP, and after reading her reviews, looking at the pics he's shared here, and looking at her Facebook page, I decided to give it a go. Boy am I glad I did! I couldn't be happier with the pics he took of my senior daughter and my about-to-leave-on-his-mission son. Can't wait for our whole family session in a few weeks - thank you so much, Stoyan!</p>

                        <p>Stoyan worked with our very eclectic group and took some truly lovely pictures! He was also very fun and easygoing to work with. I fully recommend her!</p>

                        <p>Stoyan is wonderful to work with! He's flexible and reasonable for such genuine photos. He captured my sister's spring wedding. It was very small & simple. Yet Stoyan's photos made the wedding seem like a big deal! We're so thankful.</p>

                        <p>My family had used Stoyan twice for a maternity shoot and my son's one year photos. We have been so impressed with both! Good price and Stoyan gives you a lot of good pictures. The shoot itself is a lot of fun and he makes you feel very comfortable. Photos are not too staged and you get unique shots because of the natural feel of things. Can't wait to use her again!</p>
